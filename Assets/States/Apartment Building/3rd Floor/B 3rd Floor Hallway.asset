  storyText: 'You move out into the hallway outside your apartment. Though your door
    is open, there''s precious little you can do about that right now. Your priority
    should be to leave the building, but then you did hear that scream... The lift
    is out of order, so you run to the stairway. From here you can go either up to
    the 4th floor, or down to the 2nd floor. Both stairways appear to be unobstructed.


    1:
    Go up to the 4th floor.

    2: Go down to the 2nd floor.'
