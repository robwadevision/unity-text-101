  storyText: 'You barge the door with your shoulder and it flies open after a couple
    of attempts. A young boy is sitting in the corner of the room with his head buried
    between his knees, and you can hear crying. This is no doubt the source of the
    screams.


    1: Help him leave via the door.

    2: Open the window. '
