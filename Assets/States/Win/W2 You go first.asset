  storyText: 'You jump from the window, to show the boy that there is nothing to
    be afraid of. You land in the blanket and are pulled free to the roadside. The
    boy has vanished from the window, maybe too afraid to jump. A few moments pass
    and you hear an explosion from the inside of the building.

    You survive,
    but it doesn''t feel like a victory. Not least of all because that was his mother.
